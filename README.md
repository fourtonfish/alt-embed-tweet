# Alternative Tweet Embedding

Embed Tweets on your WordPress website without 3rd party scripts, improving your site's performance and protecting your visitors' privacy.

Learn more [on fourtonfish.com](https://fourtonfish.com/projects/alternative-tweet-embedding/).

## How to use

1. [Create a new Twitter app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/dashboard) and get your API keys.
2. [Download and install the plugin.](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-upload-via-wordpress-admin)
3. Go to the plugin's settings page and add your Twitter API keys.

If you don't provide the API keys, the plugin will still work, but some data will be missing (profile pictures, number of likes and retweets) and media (images, GIFs, videos) will not render.

## Development

```sh
#install dependencies
npm install
# build front-end scripts and styles
gulp
```
