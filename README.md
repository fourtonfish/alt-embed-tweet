# Tweet Embeds

Embed Tweets without compromising your users' privacy and your site's performance.

Learn more [on fourtonfish.com](https://fourtonfish.com/project/tweet-embeds-wordpress-plugin/).

## How to use

1. [Install the plugin.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tembeds)
2. [Create a new Twitter app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/dashboard) and get your API keys.
3. Go to the plugin's settings page and add your Twitter API keys.

If you don't provide the API keys, the plugin will still work, but some data will be missing (profile pictures, number of likes and retweets) and media (images, GIFs, videos) will not render.

## Development

```sh
#install dependencies
npm install
# build front-end scripts and styles
gulp
```
