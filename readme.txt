Embed Tweets without compromising your users' privacy and your site's performance.

== Description ==

Embed Tweets without compromising your users' privacy and your site's performance. This plugin works with the [built-in Tweet Gutenberg block](https://neliosoftware.com/blog/how-to-embed-tweets-in-wordpress-with-gutenberg/) by removing Twitter's script and using Twitter's API to retrieve the data.

You can optionally provide Twitter API keys to show the number of likes and retweets and load images and other media in Tweets.
